Welcome to Sharkey's documentation!

Sharkey is a Misskey fork following upstream changes when possible,
with added features. Like any other ActivityPub software Sharkey can
interface with the thousands of servers that form the fediverse, an
interconnected social network, working in tandem with software such as
Akkoma, Mastodon, Pixelfed and many more.
