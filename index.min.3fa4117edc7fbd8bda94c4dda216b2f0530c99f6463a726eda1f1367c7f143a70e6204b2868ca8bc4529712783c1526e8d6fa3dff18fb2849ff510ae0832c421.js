docker compose up -d Manually #Same as Misskey.
Prerequisites:
NodeJS version 20.4 or later, with both npm and pnpm installed (corepack enable should suffice, make sure you run it as root if you\u0026rsquo;re using your system NodeJS) PostgreSQL version 15 or later Redis FFmpeg all the various packages to compile and build C code, and Python (on Debian-style systems, that\u0026rsquo;s build-essential \u0026amp; python) Create a sharkey user:
adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login sharkey start a shell as that user:
sudo -u sharkey -i (or something like that), then:
git clone --recurse-submodules -b stable https://github.com/transfem-org/Sharkey.git cd Sharkey pnpm install --frozen-lockfile cp .config/example.yml .config/default.yml Edit .config/default.yml, there are comments explaining what each option means. In particular, we\u0026rsquo;re going to assume you have:
url: https://{YOUR DOMAIN NAME}/ db: host: localhost port: 5432 db: sharkey user: sharkey pass: {YOUR PASSWORD} (replace {YOUR PASSWORD} with an actual password you make up for this, and {YOUR DOMAIN NAME} with the domain name we talked about at the start)
Building:
pnpm run build Create the PostgreSQL user and database, either with createuser and createdb or with sudo -u postgres psql and then:
create database sharkey with encoding = 'UTF8'; create user sharkey with encrypted password '{YOUR_PASSWORD}'; grant all privileges on database sharkey to sharkey; alter database sharkey owner to sharkey; \\q (replace {YOUR PASSWORD} with the same password as before)
Then create the schema:
pnpm run init And start it:
pnpm start you should see a series of colourful lines, ending with something like:
Now listening on port 3000 on https://example.tld but with a different URL at the end (you did change the url setting in the config file, right?). Stop that process (control-C is enough), and set up a system service for Sharkey.
With systemd #Create a file /etc/systemd/system/sharkey.service containing:
[Unit] Description=Sharkey daemon [Service] Type=simple User=sharkey ExecStart=/usr/bin/pnpm start WorkingDirectory=/home/sharkey/Sharkey Environment=\u0026quot;NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192\u0026quot; Environment=\u0026quot;NODE_ENV=production\u0026quot; TimeoutSec=60 StandardOutput=journal StandardError=journal SyslogIdentifier=sharkey Restart=always [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target (you may need to change that /usr/bin/pnpm if you\u0026rsquo;re not using your system NodeJS).
Then:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable sharkey sudo systemctl start sharkey After that, systemctl status sharkey should show that it\u0026rsquo;s running.
With OpenRC #Create a file /etc/init.d/sharkey containing:
#!/sbin/openrc-run name=sharkey description=\u0026quot;Sharkey daemon\u0026quot; command=\u0026quot;/usr/bin/pnpm\u0026quot; command_args=\u0026quot;start\u0026quot; command_user=\u0026quot;sharkey\u0026quot; supervisor=\u0026quot;supervise-daemon\u0026quot; supervise_daemon_args=\u0026quot; -d /home/sharkey/Sharkey -e NODE_ENV=production -e \\\u0026quot;NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192\\\u0026quot; pidfile=\u0026quot;/run/\${RC_SVCNAME}.pid\u0026quot; depend() { need net use logger nginx } (you may need to change that /usr/bin/pnpm if you\u0026rsquo;re not using your system NodeJS).
Then:
sudo rc-update add sharkey sudo rc-service sharkey start After that, rc-service sharkey status should show that it\u0026rsquo;s running.
Configure the web server #NGINX #See Misskey\u0026rsquo;s instructions
Update Sharkey #Very similar to the installation process:
sudo -u sharkey -i cd Sharkey git checkout stable git pull --recurse-submodules pnpm install --frozen-lockfile pnpm run build pnpm run migrate Then restart the service (sudo systemctl restart sharkey or rc-service sharkey restart).
If there\u0026rsquo;s problems with updating, you can run pnpm run clean and/or pnpm run clean-all which will remove all the effects of a previous build, then you can install+build+migrate+restart again.

If you see weirdness like service not starting, or missing labels in the web UI, you should first make sure the build worked (check all the error messages!), then try building again from scratch:
pnpm run clean-all pnpm install --frozen-lockfile pnpm run build pnpm run migrate Also, clear your browser\u0026rsquo;s cache and local storage (this will log your browser out of Misskey/Sharkey).
